# Reaction Time Challenge Game

Welcome to the Reaction Time Challenge Game! This web development project aims to provide users with an interactive game to test their reaction time. The game consists of three different challenges designed to challenge your reflexes.

## Game Features

1. **Game 1: Click the Geometric Figure**
   - A random geometric figure appears on a white screen.
   - Your goal is to click on the figure as quickly as possible once you spot it.

2. **Game 2: Color Change Reaction**
   - The entire white screen changes color.
   - Your task is to click on the screen as soon as the color change occurs.

3. **Game 3: Sound Reaction**
   - A sound is played, and you need to click on the white screen immediately after hearing the sound.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- Each game allows the user three attempts to achieve the best reaction time.
- After completing three attempts for each game, the average reaction time is calculated.
- Users can choose to submit their reaction times to the records page (requires sign-in).

## Main Page

The main page provides an overview of the game and its mechanics. It includes a brief explanation of how the game works. Additionally, you will find a table displaying the top ten best reaction times achieved by players. The table includes the user's name, their reaction time in milliseconds, and their city. If perhaps the user wants to see more than ten records, he can get a PDF file with all the times submited to the platform.
